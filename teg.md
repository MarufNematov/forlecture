# STRING

The String object is used to represent and manipulate a sequence of characters.

Strings can be created as primitives, from string literals, or as objects, using the String() constructor:
``` javascript
const string1 = "A string primitive";
const string2 = 'Also a string primitive';
const string3 = `Yet another string primitive`;
```
``` javascript 
const string4 = new String("A String object");
```

String primitives and string objects share many behaviors, but have other important differences and caveats. See "String primitives and String objects" below.

String literals can be specified using single or double quotes, which are treated identically, or using the backtick character `. This last form specifies a template literal: with this form you can interpolate expressions. For more information on the syntax of string literals, see lexical grammar.

# Comparing  string

Use the less-than and greater-than operators to compare strings:

```javascript
const a = "a";
const b = "b";
if (a < b) {
  // true
  console.log(`${a} is less than ${b}`);
} else if (a > b) {
  console.log(`${a} is greater than ${b}`);
} else {
  console.log(`${a} and ${b} are equal.`);
}
```
Note that all comparison operators, including === and ==, compare strings case-sensitively. A common way to compare strings case-insensitively is to convert both to the same case (upper or lower) before comparing them.

```javascript
function areEqualCaseInsensitive(str1, str2) {
  return str1.toUpperCase() === str2.toUpperCase();
}
```
The choice of whether to transform by toUpperCase() or toLowerCase() is mostly arbitrary, and neither one is fully robust when extending beyond the Latin alphabet. For example, the German lowercase letter √ü and ss are both transformed to SS by toUpperCase(), while the Turkish letter ƒ± would be falsely reported as unequal to I by toLowerCase() unless specifically using toLocaleLowerCase("tr").

```javascript
const areEqualInUpperCase = (str1, str2) =>
  str1.toUpperCase() === str2.toUpperCase();
const areEqualInLowerCase = (str1, str2) =>
  str1.toLowerCase() === str2.toLowerCase();

areEqualInUpperCase("√ü", "ss"); // true; should be false
areEqualInLowerCase("ƒ±", "I"); // false; should be true
```

A locale-aware and robust solution for testing case-insensitive equality is to use the Intl.Collator API or the string's localeCompare() method ‚Äî they share the same interface ‚Äî with the sensitivity option set to "accent" or "base".

```javascript
const areEqual = (str1, str2, locale = "en-US") =>
  str1.localeCompare(str2, locale, { sensitivity: "accent" }) === 0;

areEqual("√ü", "ss", "de"); // false
areEqual("ƒ±", "I", "tr"); // true

The localeCompare() method enables string comparison in a similar fashion as strcmp() ‚Äî it allows sorting strings in a locale-aware manner.
```
# String primitives and String objects

Note that JavaScript distinguishes between String objects and primitive string values. (The same is true of Boolean and Numbers.)

String literals (denoted by double or single quotes) and strings returned from String calls in a non-constructor context (that is, called without using the new keyword) are primitive strings. In contexts where a method is to be invoked on a primitive string or a property lookup occurs, JavaScript will automatically wrap the string primitive and call the method or perform the property lookup on the wrapper object instead.
```javascript
const strPrim = "foo"; // A literal is a string primitive
const strPrim2 = String(1); // Coerced into the string primitive "1"
const strPrim3 = String(true); // Coerced into the string primitive "true"
const strObj = new String(strPrim); // String with new returns a string wrapper object.

console.log(typeof strPrim); // "string"
console.log(typeof strPrim2); // "string"
console.log(typeof strPrim3); // "string"
console.log(typeof strObj); // "object"
```

You must be careful which level of characters you are iterating on. For example, split("") will split by UTF-16 code units and will separate surrogate pairs. String indexes also refer to the index of each UTF-16 code unit. On the other hand, @@iterator() iterates by Unicode code points. Iterating through grapheme clusters will require some custom code.
```javascript"".split(""); // ['\ud83d', '\ude04']; splits into two lone surrogates

// "Backhand Index Pointing Right: Dark Skin Tone"
[...""]; // ['', 'üèø']
// splits into the basic "Backhand Index Pointing Right" emoji and
// the "Dark skin tone" emoji

// "Family: Man, Boy"
[...""]; // [ '', '‚Äç', '' ]
// splits into the "Man" and "Boy" emoji, joined by a ZWJ

// The United Nations flag
[..."üá∫üá≥"]; // [ 'üá∫', 'üá≥' ]
// splits into two "region indicator" letters "U" and "N".
// All flag emojis are formed by joining two region indicator letters
```

String primitives and String objects also give different results when using eval(). Primitives passed to eval are treated as source code; String objects are treated as all other objects are, by returning the object. For example:
```javascrip 
tconst s1 = "2 + 2"; // creates a string primitive
const s2 = new String("2 + 2"); // creates a String object
console.log(eval(s1)); // returns the number 4
console.log(eval(s2)); // returns the string "2 + 2"

```
The String() function is a more reliable way of converting values to strings than calling the toString() method of the value, as the former works when used on null and undefined. For example:

```javascript 
const nullVar = null;
nullVar.toString(); // TypeError: Cannot read properties of null
String(nullVar); // "null"

const undefinedVar = undefined;
undefinedVar.toString(); // TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
String(undefinedVar); // "undefined"
